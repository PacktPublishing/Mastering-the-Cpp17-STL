# Mastering the C++17 STL
This is the code repository for [Mastering the C++17 STL](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-c17-stl?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=9781787126824), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
In this book, you will see the most important features of the C++17 standard library. In the interest of brevity, some parts are omitted, such as <type_traits>; but we'll cover the entire modern STL (every standard container and every standard algorithm), plus such important topics as smart pointers, random numbers, regular expressions, and the new-in-C++17 <filesystem> library. You'll learn to build your own iterator type; your own memory allocator using std::pmr::memory_resource; your own thread pool using std::future.

## Instructions and Navigation
The code for Chapter 05 is organized into one folder, Chapter05 and the rest in one separate folder. Chapter 01 and Chapter 02 does not have code.

The code will look like the following:

```
public class Program
{
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    BuildWebHost(args).Run();
  }
}
```
